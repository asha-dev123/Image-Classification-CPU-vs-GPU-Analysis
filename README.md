# Insect Classification using Fine-Tuned CNN (MobileNetV3Large)

This project benchmarks the performance of a **fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification on **GPU vs CPU** using **TensorFlow**.

##  Project Summary
We used **MobileNetV3Large** pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned it to classify insect species from a custom dataset of 5 classes:
- **Bees**
- **Butterfly**
- **Moth**
- **Scorpion**
- **Spider**

The model is trained using data augmentation and evaluated based on accuracy and training time across GPU and CPU hardware platforms.

## How to Run in Google Colab

1. Enable GPU runtime in Colab
2. Upload or download the dataset to `/dataset/train/` and `/dataset/validation/`
3. Open and run:
   - `Insect_Classification_Colab.ipynb` to train the model
   - `GPU_vs_CPU_Benchmark_Insect_Classification.ipynb` to compare hardware performance
